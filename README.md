# Campus-Navigational-Map
Welcome to the UW Madison Campus Map project, an interactive navigational tool designed to streamline campus traversal for students, faculty, and visitors. This project harnesses the power of directed weighted graphs to map the intricate network of pathways and routes across the UW Madison campus. Whether you prefer walking or taking the bus, our application efficiently calculates the shortest path to your destination, considering various factors like travel time, crowd density, and terrain. Leveraging the robustness of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation, this application caters to diverse travel preferences, offering optimized paths for both pedestrians and bus commuters. With its advanced multi-stop capabilities, users can efficiently plan routes with multiple destinations, ensuring a time-saving and hassle-free travel experience.

## Features
Customized Routing: Get directions tailored to your preferred mode of travel â€“ walking or bussing.<br>
Multi-stop Itineraries: Plan complex routes with multiple destinations.<br>
Dynamic Map Interaction: Add or remove campus landmarks and routes as needed.<br>
Graphical User Interface: Enjoy a seamless and intuitive navigation experience.


## Future Scope
Enhancements: Introduce additional features like multiple bus routes, cycling paths, real-time building and traffic information, and live location tracking.<br>
Simplifications: Consider reducing complexity by focusing on core functionalities, potentially scaling down the multi-stop feature or the dual-mode (bus and walking) routing system.

## External Libraries and Tools
This project is primarily built on standard Java libraries and JavaFX for frontend development.
